# React Native useRef Hook Returns Null Inconsitently

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug in React Native applications involving the `useRef` hook. The issue arises when a ref's current value unexpectedly remains null even after the component has mounted and rendered. This inconsistency is often triggered within event handlers or following state updates.

## Problem

The provided `UnexpectedNullRef.js` file illustrates the problem. A ref is attached to a text input.  Despite the component successfully mounting, attempts to access `myRef.current` within an event handler may return `null`, leading to errors or unexpected behavior.

## Solution

The `UnexpectedNullRefSolution.js` file presents a solution. The key is to ensure the ref's current value is accessed only *after* the component has fully mounted and rendered, and to protect against situations where the ref might not yet be fully available. This often involves using state management to signal component readiness or employing a check to handle potential null values safely.
